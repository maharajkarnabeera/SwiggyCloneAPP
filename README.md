# SwiggyClone
Created Swiggy Clone using real time swiggy API, ReactJS and Redux. To see this app you need to use a CORS extension in Chrome. This app is just implemented for Practice only 
- used Parcel for Bundling
- used React Router for routing
- used ReduxToolKit(RTK) for state management
- used Tailwindcss
note: we can implement this without redux using contextAPI for Practice purpose we have used RTK for state management.
